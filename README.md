Developer setup
---------------

### Requirements

- Java 8
- Latest version of Android SDK and Android Build Tools

### API Key

The app uses themoviedb.org API to get movie information and posters. You must provide your own [API key][1] in order to build the app.

Just put your API key into `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file (create the file if it does not exist already):

```gradle
MY_MOVIE_DB_API_KEY="api key goes here"
```

### Building

You can build the app with Android Studio or with `./gradlew assembleDebug` command.

### Testing

This project integrates a combination of [local unit tests][2], [instrumented tests][3] and [code analysis tools][4].

Just run `build.sh` to ensure that project code is valid and stable.
This will run local unit tests on the JVM, instrumented tests on connected device (or emulator) and analyse code with Checkstyle, Findbugs and PMD.
